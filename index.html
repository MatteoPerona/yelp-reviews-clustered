        <h1 class="section">Yelp Review Sentiment Breakdown</h1>

        <h2 class="section">Introduction</h2>
        Yelp is an online platform where users can find and share reviews for businesses like restaurants, hotels, and
        more. It helps people make informed decisions by providing ratings and opinions from others.
        For this project I used the Yelp Academic Dataset, a large collection of data made available by Yelp for academic research purposes.
        It contains a wealth of information, including user reviews, business details, user
        profiles, check-ins, and more. In this project, I seek to break down the
        general sentiment in a business' reviews. To do this, I vectoried the
        review data by creating a TF-IDF matrix and used K-Means Clustering to 
        derive groups from those vectors. I also generated a similarity matrix 
        for the vectors using cosine similarity. In the graphs below I will walk you 
        through the results.

            <h3>Summary of Review Clusters - Table Based</h3>
            <p>
                The visual below was created to summarize the data in each review 
                cluster. Each circle represents one cluster, there are 10 total
                for each business. The radius of the circles corresponds with 
                the relative number of reviews in that cluster -- a bigger circle
                is a cluster with more reviews. The other main aspect of this visusual
                is position. I used singular value decomposition to reduce the centroid
                vectors for each cluster from thousands of dimensions down to 
                just two. The resulting 2D centroids give us an idea for how similar
                each cluster is relative to its neighbors. Clusters that are overlapping
                are likely much more similar than clusters that are distant. To 
                get an idea for the sentiment in each cluster, hover your mouse 
                over the corresponding circle and it will show the top 5 words 
                for that cluster. 
                The final
                aspect of this visual that's worth mentioning is color: used to 
                distinguish between clusters. Opacity was turned down such that 
                each overlapping cluster is visible. 
                Note: Pay little attention to the values on the axes I left them 
                in to give an idea for the difference in scale between the x and
                y axes. Remember the important factor is not the number itself, 
                but the distance you see between clusters.

            <h3>Graph of Reviews - Network Based</h3>

            <p>
                This node link graph is generated to visualize a different type 
                of review grouping. Each node is a review, each link is generated
                between a node and another node with the highest cosine similarity 
                to it. In this way, we've generated a somewhat different form of clusters. 
                The stroke width of each link corresponds to the magnitude of similarity. 
                Each node was colored based on its k-means cluster in order to see
                if there is continuity between groups generated with k-means vs 
                cosine similarity. I would recommend looking at this visual on a 
                desktop, and to use a mouse when navigating.

            <h3>Map of Businesses - Geometry Based</h3>
            <p> 
                Here, I have included a map to locate each of the yelp businesses.
                Each business is marked with a red dot. Hover your cursor over the
                dot to reveal the business name. 
                Note: The locations have been chosen arbitrarily for the time being.
